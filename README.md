# OpenSCAD Pegboard Collection

This is a collection of customizable 3D-printable things that can be attached to
any pegboard, given its dimensions.

We're not providing the STL files in this repository, as your needs may
vary. Use the code here to generate your STL files

Some of them are more specialized (e.g. pliers holder and reel), and some are
more general purpose objects that may be useful for several needs.

## How to use

### Using Thingiverse Customizer

Work in progress

### Running locally

This was created using OpenSCAD, a CAD software and programming language. If you
know OpenSCAD, you can edit the code directly according to your needs. If you
adon't know OpenSCAD, no problem. You can run it through the OpenSCAD GUI or
CLI, without touching the code.

Download OpenSCAD [here](https://openscad.org/downloads.html).
